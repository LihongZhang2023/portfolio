This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  My name is Lihong Zhang (She/Her). I have been an employee at Carnegie Mellon University since 2018. I enrolled in Master of Applied Second Acquisition program at Dietrich College in Auguest 2018 and graduated in December 2021. Following my graduation, I decided to pursue another graduate degree in Public Management at Heinz College to futher my knowledge on Technology, analytics and leadership practice.

In todayâ€™s digital world, the ability to make data-driven decisions and create strategy informed by analysis is central to successful leadership in any industry. I realized Data analytics is an important skill for institutions and businesses. I have taken data science related courses such as Database Management, Data Analytics with Tableau in previous semesters. And I plan to dive deeper into data anaylitics along the way.

# What I hope to learn
Through the Telling Story with Data course, I hope to learn:
1. designing data visualization more effectively.
2. New tools and techniques for data visualization and analystics
3. New ways to represent data about my work.
